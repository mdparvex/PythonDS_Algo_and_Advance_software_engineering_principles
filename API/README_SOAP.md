# ðŸ“˜ Technical Documentation: SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

## 1\. Introduction

Before REST and GraphQL became popular, **SOAP** was the dominant standard for building APIs, especially in **enterprise applications** like banking, payment systems, and government services.

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a **protocol** developed by Microsoft, IBM, and others in the late 1990s. Unlike REST or GraphQL (which are architectural styles), SOAP is a **strict messaging protocol** that relies on **XML-based communication**.

## 2\. What is SOAP?

**SOAP** is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services using **XML messages**. It defines rules for **message structure, encoding, and transport**, making it platform-agnostic and language-independent.

SOAP messages are usually transmitted over **HTTP** (though other protocols like SMTP are also supported). SOAP often works with **WSDL (Web Services Description Language)**, which acts like a contract describing what operations are available and how to call them.

### Key Principles of SOAP

1. **Strict Standards** â†’ Messages must follow XML schema and SOAP specification.
2. **Protocol-Independent** â†’ Can work over HTTP, SMTP, TCP, etc.
3. **Extensibility** â†’ Supports features like security, transactions, and reliability.
4. **WSDL Contracts** â†’ Clients generate code based on WSDL, ensuring strict typing.
5. **Built-in Error Handling** â†’ SOAP has a standard &lt;Fault&gt; element for errors.
6. **Security (WS-Security)** â†’ Strong enterprise-level security features.

## 3\. SOAP API Example

Imagine a **Bookstore API** in SOAP.

### SOAP Request (XML)

```xml
POST /BookService HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8

<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <GetBookRequest xmlns="http://example.com/books">
      <BookId>1</BookId>
    </GetBookRequest>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

### SOAP Response (XML)

```xml
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <GetBookResponse xmlns="http://example.com/books">
      <Book>
        <Id>1</Id>
        <Title>The Pragmatic Programmer</Title>
        <Author>Andrew Hunt</Author>
        <PublishedYear>1999</PublishedYear>
      </Book>
    </GetBookResponse>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

ðŸ‘‰ Unlike REST (JSON) or GraphQL, SOAP responses are **verbose** and **XML-only**.

## 4\. Why Use SOAP?

### Advantages

- **Strong Standards** â†’ Built-in rules for messaging, error handling, and contracts.
- **High Security** â†’ WS-Security for authentication, encryption, and integrity.
- **Reliable Messaging** â†’ Supports transactions, retries, and ACID compliance.
- **Formal Contracts** â†’ WSDL provides strict type safety and documentation.
- **Protocol Independence** â†’ Works over HTTP, SMTP, TCP, JMS, etc.

## 5\. SOAP vs Other API Technologies

### 5.1 SOAP vs REST

| **Feature** | **SOAP** | **REST** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Format | XML only | JSON, XML, plain text, YAML |
| Protocol | Multiple (HTTP, SMTP, TCP) | HTTP only |
| Standards | Strict (WSDL, WS-Security) | Flexible, less formal |
| Payload Size | Large, verbose XML | Lightweight JSON |
| Performance | Slower (XML parsing overhead) | Faster |
| Use Case | Enterprise apps, banking, B2B | Web/mobile applications |

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

- **SOAP** â†’ ```url <GetBookRequest><BookId>1</BookId></GetBookRequest> ```
- **REST** â†’ ```url GET /books/1 ```

### 5.2 SOAP vs GraphQL

| **Feature** | **SOAP** | **GraphQL** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Format | XML only | JSON |
| Endpoints | Multiple operations (WSDL) | Single endpoint /graphql |
| Flexibility | Low (fixed WSDL contract) | High (client chooses fields) |
| Complexity | High | Moderate |
| Use Case | Enterprise systems | Modern web/mobile apps |

### 5.3 SOAP vs gRPC

| **Feature** | **SOAP** | **gRPC** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Format | XML (text-based) | Protocol Buffers (binary) |
| Transport | HTTP, SMTP, etc. | HTTP/2 |
| Speed | Slower | Much faster |
| Security | Strong WS-Security | Relies on TLS |
| Use Case | Enterprise transactions | High-performance microservices |

## 6\. When to Choose SOAP?

You should choose **SOAP** when:

- Working in **enterprise systems** (banking, healthcare, insurance, government).
- You need **strict contracts (WSDL)** between client and server.
- **Security and reliability** are top priorities.
- You need **ACID-compliant transactions**.
- Interoperability with **legacy systems** is required.

## 7\. Conclusion

SOAP is a **protocol-based, XML-driven API technology** with strong standards, security, and reliability features. Although it is heavier and slower compared to REST, GraphQL, and gRPC, SOAP remains highly relevant in **enterprise-grade applications** where **security, reliability, and strict contracts** are required.

Today, most public APIs use REST or GraphQL, but SOAP is still widely used in **banking, finance, B2B integrations, and government systems**.

âœ… **In short**:

- Use **SOAP** for **enterprise-grade applications** where **security and strict contracts** are required.
- Use **REST** for general-purpose web/mobile apps.
- Use **GraphQL** for flexible data queries with relational structures.
- Use **gRPC** for **high-performance, low-latency microservices**.
