# 📘 Distributed Systems — Complete Guide

## 1\. ⚙️ What is a Distributed System?

A **distributed system** is a collection of **independent computers (nodes)** that appears to its users as a **single coherent system**.

### 🧠 Key Characteristics

- Nodes communicate over a network.
- Each node has its own memory and CPU.
- The system continues to function even if some nodes fail.

### 🔄 Real-World Examples

- Microservices architecture
- Google Search
- Amazon AWS
- Apache Kafka
- Distributed databases like Cassandra, MongoDB, etc.

## 2\. ⚖️ CAP Theorem

The **CAP Theorem** (also called Brewer’s Theorem) describes the fundamental trade-offs in distributed systems.

### 📐 Definition

In any distributed data system, you can only guarantee **two out of three** properties:  
**C**onsistency, **A**vailability, and **P**artition Tolerance.

### 🔍 Definitions

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Consistency (C)** | Every read receives the most recent write (no stale data). |
| **Availability (A)** | Every request receives a response, even if some nodes fail. |
| **Partition Tolerance (P)** | The system continues operating despite network partitions (loss of communication between nodes). |

### 🧠 The Trade-off

⛔ **You can’t have all three** in the presence of a network partition (which is inevitable in real-world systems).

| **Combination** | **Explanation** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CP** | Consistent + Partition-tolerant, but may sacrifice availability | HBase, MongoDB (in strong consistency mode) |
| **AP** | Available + Partition-tolerant, but may return stale data | CouchDB, Cassandra |
| **CA** | Consistent + Available, but not partition-tolerant (theoretically only works on single node) | RDBMS on a single server |

### 🧪 Example Scenario

Imagine a distributed online banking system:

- **Consistency**: When Alice transfers money, Bob must see the updated balance.
- **Availability**: If a server crashes, you still want to serve requests.
- **Partition Tolerance**: The network might drop messages between nodes.

❗ During a partition:

- If you prioritize **Consistency**, you might delay Bob's request until data syncs.
- If you prioritize **Availability**, Bob might see stale data.

## 3\. 📜 Consensus in Distributed Systems

In a distributed system, nodes must **agree on a value** (e.g., the state of a database, a leader, or the order of messages). This process is called **consensus**.

### 🔍 Why Consensus Is Hard

- Nodes may crash or be unreachable.
- Messages may be delayed, duplicated, or lost.
- Nodes must agree even with partial failures.

### ✅ Properties of a Consensus Algorithm

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Termination** | Every non-faulty process eventually decides. |
| **Agreement** | No two processes decide differently. |
| **Validity** | The decision value must have been proposed by some process. |

## 4\. 🧠 Common Consensus Algorithms

### 📘 1. ****Paxos****

- Designed by Leslie Lamport.
- Guarantees safety, but complex to implement.
- Involves roles: **Proposer**, **Acceptor**, and **Learner**.

🔁 Works by sending proposal rounds and reaching quorum (majority agreement).

### 📘 2. ****Raft**** (more readable alternative to Paxos)

- Easier to understand and implement.
- Used by many systems like etcd, Consul.

🧱 Key Concepts:

- **Leader Election**
- **Log Replication**
- **Safety** (no conflicting logs)
- **Followers**, **Leader**, **Candidates**

🔄 If the leader crashes, nodes vote to elect a new leader.

### 📘 3. ****ZAB (ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast)****

- Used in Apache ZooKeeper.
- Designed for high throughput and low latency coordination.

### 🧪 Raft Leader Election Example

```text
Cluster: Node A, Node B, Node C

1. All nodes are followers.
2. Node A’s timer expires → becomes a candidate.
3. Sends vote requests to B and C.
4. If it gets majority (2/3), becomes the leader.
5. Now handles all client write requests.

```

If Node A crashes:

- B or C will start a new election and take over.

## 5\. 🏗️ Real-World Distributed System Use Cases

| **System** | **Design** | **Why?** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Kafka** | Partitioned log system with leader election (Zookeeper) | Fault tolerance, high availability |
| **Cassandra** | AP system (availability prioritized over consistency) | Writes always succeed, read-repair corrects stale data |
| **MongoDB** | CP system when using strong consistency | Guarantees correct data at cost of availability during network issues |
| **etcd / Consul** | Use Raft for consensus | Store configs and service discovery info safely |
| **Redis Sentinel** | Leader election using quorum | Provides HA with automatic failover |

## 6\. 🛠️ Tips for Building Distributed Systems

| **Tip** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- |
| Use retries & timeouts | Assume network calls will fail |
| Idempotent operations | Ensure re-executing requests has no side effects |
| Monitor latency & health | Track and respond to slow or unhealthy services |
| Use circuit breakers | Avoid calling broken services repeatedly |
| Prefer eventual consistency where possible | Don't block the whole system for consistency |

Below is a complete **Django Microservices Demo Project Plan** that simulates **CAP theorem** principles and **Raft-like consensus** using simplified logic. While you can't implement a full Raft protocol easily without a distributed state machine and persistent logs, you can simulate the behavior and decision-making process to learn how these systems behave.

# 🚀 Django Microservices Demo: CAP + Raft Simulation

## 🧱 Project Overview

We’ll build a system with **three microservices**:

| **Service** | **Responsibility** |
| --- | --- |
| **User Service** | Manages users (register, login) |
| **Order Service** | Handles orders (create, cancel) |
| **Consensus Service** | Simulates Raft-like leader election and state consistency |

These services communicate via REST APIs (or RabbitMQ/Kafka if needed).

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| **Layer** | **Tool** |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | Django + DRF |
| Messaging (optional) | Redis Pub/Sub or RabbitMQ |
| Load Simulation | Docker Compose |
| API Simulation | Postman / Python Requests |
| DB (distributed simulation) | SQLite or PostgreSQL |

## 📁 Microservices Folder Structure

```bash
distributed-system/
├── user_service/
│   └── Django app for user
├── order_service/
│   └── Django app for order
├── consensus_service/
│   └── Django app simulating Raft
├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md

```

## 🔗 Interactions & Goals

### 1\. Simulating CAP

| **Scenario** | **Simulated Behavior** |
| --- | --- |
| Network Partition | Disable a service using Docker |
| Availability vs Consistency | Try accessing Order API when DB is disconnected |
| Eventual Consistency | Delay Order DB update, then sync with Leader later |

### 2\. Simulating Raft

| **Component** | **What It Does** |
| --- | --- |
| Leader Node | Handles all writes |
| Followers | Forward write requests to Leader |
| Election | If Leader is down, followers elect a new one |
| Heartbeats | Optional simulation with Redis Pub/Sub or API pings |

## 📦 Service Details

### 🔹 1. User Service (user_service/)

- Endpoint: /api/register/, /api/login/
- DB: SQLite/PostgreSQL
- No CAP issue here — works independently.

### 🔹 2. Order Service (order_service/)

- Endpoint: /api/order/, /api/order/&lt;id&gt;/
- Works **only if Leader Node is available**.
- All write requests are **forwarded to the leader** via REST.

**Example**:

```python
# order_service/views.py

def create_order(request):
    leader_url = get_current_leader_url()
    if not leader_url:
        return JsonResponse({'error': 'Leader unavailable'}, status=503)
    
    response = requests.post(f'{leader_url}/api/leader/create_order/', data=request.data)
    return JsonResponse(response.json(), status=response.status_code)

```

### 🔹 3. Consensus Service (consensus_service/)

Simulates:

- Node states: Leader / Follower / Candidate
- Heartbeats
- Leader election
- Persistent leader info via Redis or shared file

**Endpoints**:

- /api/health/
- /api/leader/heartbeat/
- /api/leader/elect/

**Leader election logic** (simplified):

```python
# consensus_service/leader.py

LEADER = None

def elect_leader(nodes):
    # naive election: first healthy node becomes leader
    for node in nodes:
        if is_node_healthy(node):
            global LEADER
            LEADER = node
            return node
    return None

```

## 🐳 Docker Compose Setup

### 📄 docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  user_service:
    build: ./user_service
    ports:
      - "8001:8000"

  order_service:
    build: ./order_service
    ports:
      - "8002:8000"

  consensus_service:
    build: ./consensus_service
    ports:
      - "8003:8000"

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

```

## ✅ Simulated CAP Scenarios

| **Test** | **What to do** | **Expected** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Partition | Stop order_service in Docker | Requests fail (Partition Tolerance) |
| Availability over Consistency | Accept writes during partition | Leader syncs data later |
| Strong Consistency | All nodes write via leader | Fail if leader is down |

## ✅ Simulated Raft Scenarios

| **Scenario** | **Simulation** |
| --- | --- |
| Leader down | Stop consensus service |
| Heartbeat missed | Use timeout to trigger election |
| Client writes to follower | Forwarded to leader |

## 🔍 Bonus Features (Optional)

- Add @silk_profile or cProfile to profile latency
- Track quorum votes using Redis keys
- Add WebSocket for live leader state
- Implement snapshot for state sync

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash

# Build and run all services

docker-compose up --build
```
Then visit:

- <http://localhost:8001> → User Service
- <http://localhost:8002> → Order Service
- <http://localhost:8003> → Consensus Service

## 📌 Summary of Learning Outcomes

| **Concept** | **What You Learn** |
| --- | --- |
| CAP Theorem | Trade-offs between consistency, availability, partition tolerance |
| Consensus | How leader election, heartbeats, and replication work |
| Microservices | Building independent Django apps that interact |
| Docker | Run isolated services for distributed simulation |

Let's break down **CAP Theorem** step by step and then look at **real-life examples** to solidify the concept.

## ✅ What is CAP Theorem?

CAP Theorem is a fundamental principle in **distributed systems**, introduced by **Eric Brewer** in 2000. It states that:

**A distributed system can only guarantee two out of the following three properties at the same time:**

- **C** – **Consistency**
- **A** – **Availability**
- **P** – **Partition Tolerance**

### 🔹 Let’s define the three terms

| **Term** | **Description** | **Analogy** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Consistency (C)** | Every read gets the **most recent write** or an error. | Like a single truth – everyone sees the same value. |
| **Availability (A)** | Every request receives a **non-error response**, without guarantee it contains the latest write. | Like a vending machine – always gives a snack, even if it's stale. |
| **Partition Tolerance (P)** | The system continues to function **even if network partitions (failures)** occur. | Like two offices still working even if their network connection is down. |

## 📘 CAP in Practice: Only 2 out of 3

In a real distributed system, you **must tolerate partitions (P)** – network failures are inevitable. So, the trade-off usually is between **Consistency (C)** and **Availability (A)**.

## 🧠 Visual Summary

```css
   Consistency
      /\
     /  \
    /    \
   /      \
  /        \
 /          \
A ------------ P
Availability   Partition Tolerance

```

## 📦 Real-World Examples of CAP Systems

### ****1\. CP System (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)****

- **Guarantees:** Consistent and survives partitions, but might be unavailable during failures.

#### 🔸 Example: **MongoDB (with strong consistency settings), HBase, Redis Sentinel (master election)**

#### 🧪 Scenario

Suppose a **banking system** where accurate balance is critical.

- You withdraw money from an ATM in Dhaka.
- At the same time, your spouse tries to check the balance from Chattogram.
- If the network is partitioned, the system will **deny one of the requests** to **ensure consistent data**.

👉 **Better to be unavailable than show incorrect balance.**

### ****2\. AP System (Availability + Partition Tolerance)****

- **Guarantees:** Always available, even during network issues, but consistency might be sacrificed.

#### 🔸 Example: **CouchDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, Akka Cluster**

#### 🧪 Scenario

A **social media platform** like Instagram.

- You post a picture.
- Due to a network partition, a friend in another region may **not see your latest post immediately**, but they can still use the app.

👉 Prioritizes being online and usable at all times, even with **eventual consistency**.

### ****3\. CA System (Consistency + Availability)****

- **Guarantees:** Always consistent and available, **but only if there are no partitions**.

#### 🔸 Example: **Traditional SQL database on a single node** (like PostgreSQL, MySQL)

#### 🧪 Scenario

- You run a **centralized inventory system** within a store with no distributed nodes.
- All transactions are immediately consistent and available.

👉 But if the server crashes or loses network connection, the system is **down**.

## 💡 Why is Partition Tolerance Non-Negotiable?

In any **real distributed system**, especially over a network (cloud, multiple data centers), **network partitions are unavoidable**. So systems are designed to **handle them (P)** and choose between **Consistency (C)** or **Availability (A)**.

## 📋 Summary Table

| **CAP Property** | **MongoDB** | **Cassandra** | **Redis Sentinel** | **MySQL (single node)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Consistency** | ✅ (if tuned) | ❌ (eventual) | ✅   | ✅   |
| **Availability** | ❌ (can become unavailable) | ✅   | ❌ (during failover) | ✅   |
| **Partition Tolerance** | ✅   | ✅   | ✅   | ❌   |

## 🏁 Final Thought

**You can't have everything** in a distributed system. CAP forces you to choose what matters most based on your use case:

- **Banking?** → Choose **CP**
- **Social media, messaging?** → Choose **AP**
- **Local server apps?** → Use **CA** (if no partition expected)
