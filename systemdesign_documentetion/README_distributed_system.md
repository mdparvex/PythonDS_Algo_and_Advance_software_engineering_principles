## 1. Executive summary
A *distributed system* is a collection of independent computers that appears to users as a single coherent system. This documentation explains the architecture, patterns, trade-offs, and operational concerns of distributed systems. It provides practical examples and hands-on use cases (microservices, distributed databases, real-time streaming, and IoT) so engineers can design, build, and operate robust distributed systems.

## 2. What is a distributed system?
- **Definition:** Multiple machines (nodes) coordinate over a network to achieve a single goal.
- **Goals:** Scalability, availability, fault tolerance, performance, and manageability.
- **Examples:** Web services behind a load balancer, a replicated database, content delivery networks (CDN), Kafka clusters.

### Why distributed systems?
- Handle larger workloads than a single machine.
- Provide redundancy to reduce downtime.
- Move computation closer to users (geo-distribution).

## 3. Core components and terminology
- **Node / Host / Server:** A machine participating in the system.
- **Client:** The consumer of the service (could be a browser, mobile app, or other services).
- **Coordinator / Leader:** A node that coordinates work (may be elected dynamically).
- **Replica:** Copy of data on different nodes for availability and durability.
- **Partition (Shard):** Subset of the dataset assigned to a node or group of nodes.
- **Broker / Message queue:** Intermediary for asynchronous messaging (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
- **RPC / gRPC / HTTP:** Inter-process communication mechanisms.
- **Consensus:** Agreement among nodes about a value/state (e.g., Raft, Paxos).

## 4. Architectural patterns
### 4.1 Client–Server
Classic pattern: clients send requests, servers respond. Add load balancers and autoscaling groups for scale.

### 4.2 Peer-to-peer
Nodes are equal peers and may act as clients and servers (e.g., blockchain, BitTorrent).

### 4.3 Master–Worker
A master assigns tasks to workers. Useful for distributed processing and batch jobs.

### 4.4 Microservices
System split into independently deployable services communicating over the network. Encourages bounded contexts and technology heterogeneity.

### 4.5 Event-driven / Streaming
Services react to events (event sourcing, CQRS). Useful for real-time analytics, change-data-capture.

### 4.6 Shared-nothing architecture
Nodes do not share memory or disk; they communicate only via the network. Scales well horizontally.

## 5. Communication patterns
### 5.1 Synchronous request/response
- Examples: HTTP REST, gRPC
- Pros: Simpler reasoning; immediate response
- Cons: Tight coupling and blocking latency

### 5.2 Asynchronous messaging
- Examples: Kafka, RabbitMQ
- Pros: Decoupling, resilience to slow consumers
- Cons: More complex consistency semantics

### 5.3 Streaming
- Persistent ordered log of events (Kafka). Good for durable event processing.

### 5.4 Publish/Subscribe
Producers publish messages to topics; subscribers receive relevant messages.

### 5.5 Bulk data movement
- For large datasets, use streaming or specialized protocols (S3 multipart upload, rsync-style replication).

## 6. Consistency, availability, partition tolerance (CAP)
- **CAP theorem:** In the presence of a network partition, a distributed system must choose between *consistency* (all nodes see the same data) and *availability* (system keeps responding).
- **Consistency models:** Strong consistency, eventual consistency, causal consistency.

### Practical guidance
- Use strong consistency when correctness requires it (banking transfers).
- Eventual consistency is acceptable for social feeds, caches.
- Many systems offer tunable consistency (e.g., read/write quorum sizes).

## 7. Data replication and partitioning (sharding)
### 7.1 Replication
- **Synchronous replication:** Writes are confirmed only when replicas persist them (higher durability, higher latency).
- **Asynchronous replication:** Faster writes but risk of data loss on failure.

### 7.2 Partitioning (Sharding)
- Split data by key ranges or hash to distribute load.
- Consider re-sharding strategy for growth (consistent hashing decreases re-shard cost).

### Example: Read/Write flow with quorum
- Write goes to leader; leader replicates to followers.
- When using quorum W and R (W + R > N), you can guarantee read-your-writes depending on configuration.

## 8. Consensus and coordination
### 8.1 Why consensus?
To agree on a single source of truth (e.g., who is leader, what is committed log index).

### 8.2 Algorithms
- **Paxos:** Proven but complex; building blocks for other systems.
- **Raft:** Easier to understand; used in etcd, Consul.
- **Zab:** Used by ZooKeeper.

### 8.3 Leader election
Leader reduces complexity by centralizing coordination. Use Raft/etcd/Consul or Zookeeper for coordination primitives.

### 8.4 Example: Distributed lock using etcd
- Client creates a lease in etcd and writes a key bound to the lease. If client fails, lease expires and lock is released.

## 9. Fault tolerance and failure modes
### 9.1 Common failures
- Network partitions and packet loss
- Node crashes and disk failures
- Slow nodes and garbage collection pauses
- Byzantine failures (rare, require different models)

### 9.2 Design for failure
- Expect failures — design to detect and recover.
- Use retries with exponential backoff, idempotent operations.
- Circuit breakers for failing downstream services.
- Timeouts and deadlines for RPCs.

### 9.3 Data durability strategies
- Durable write-ahead logs
- Replication across AZs/regions
- Backups and snapshots

## 10. Observability, testing, and deployment
### 10.1 Observability
- **Logging:** Structured logs (JSON), correlation IDs for tracing.
- **Metrics:** Latency, throughput, error rates, queue depth.
- **Tracing:** Distributed traces (OpenTelemetry) to visualize request paths.

### 10.2 Testing strategies
- **Unit tests** for individual components.
- **Integration tests** for services interacting.
- **Chaos testing** (Chaos Monkey) to inject failures and observe resilience.
- **Property-based testing** for invariants.

### 10.3 Deployment
- Blue/Green or Canary deployments for safer rollouts.
- Use orchestration (Kubernetes, Nomad) with health checks and autoscaling.

## 11. Security considerations
- Mutual TLS for service-to-service authentication.
- OAuth/OpenID Connect for user auth.
- Principle of least privilege for service accounts.
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
- Regular secret rotation and secure secret storage (Vault, KMS).

## 12. Example architectures and use cases
### Use case A — Microservices for e-commerce
**Requirements:** Orders, catalog, payments, inventory, and search. High availability and consistent inventory counts.

**Architecture:**
- API Gateway -> Authentication -> Microservices (Order, Catalog, Inventory, Payment).
- Inventory uses leader-based consensus for critical decrements or uses optimistic updates + compensation transactions.
- Event bus (Kafka) for asynchronous communication: inventory update events, order events, shipping events.

**Important trade-offs:**
- Inventory strong consistency vs. performance: use a single region synchronized service for stock-critical operations and eventual consistency for analytics.

### Use case B — Real-time analytics pipeline
**Requirements:** Process clickstream events in real time, update dashboards, store long-term.

**Architecture:**
- Clients -> Edge collectors -> Kafka topic(s) -> Stream processors (Flink/Beam) -> Materialized views (Elasticsearch/ClickHouse) -> Dashboards.

**Design notes:**
- Use compact binary protocol for events (Avro/Protobuf).
- Ensure event schema evolution and backward compatibility.

### Use case C — Distributed database
**Requirements:** Global read scale and regional write scale, tolerate datacenter failures.

**Architecture variants:**
- Multi-primary multi-region (conflict resolution required) or single-primary per-region with async replication.
- Use consistent hashing for shard distribution.

**Example product analogues:** Cassandra (AP, eventual consistency), Spanner (global strong consistency with synchronized clocks), CockroachDB (distributed SQL with Raft).

### Use case D — IoT telemetry collection
**Requirements:** Millions of intermittent devices sending telemetry, offline buffering, long-term storage.

**Architecture:**
- Gateways (edge) for ingestion -> MQTT/Kafka -> Stream processing -> Cold storage (object store) -> ML pipelines.

**Design notes:**
- Use device-side buffering and backpressure to handle intermittent connectivity.

## 13. Design checklist and best practices
**Before design**
- Clarify SLAs: latency, throughput, availability, durability.
- Choose the correct consistency model.
- Decide on partitioning key strategy early.

**During design**
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility).
- Define retry and idempotency semantics.
- Use correlation IDs and tracing from day one.
- Plan for schema evolution and versioning.

**Operational**
- Automate deployment and rollbacks.
- Monitor capacity and slow consumers.
- Practice disaster recovery with runbooks.

## 14. Glossary
- **Idempotency:** Safe repeated execution of the same operation.
- **Quorum:** Minimum number of nodes required to agree for an operation to be considered committed.
- **Leader:** Node that coordinates certain types of operations.
- **Eventual consistency:** System will become consistent if no new updates occur.

## 15. Further reading / next steps
- Hands-on: Build a simple distributed key-value store using Raft.
- Implement a Kafka-based event pipeline for a small web app.
- Exercises: write integration tests that simulate network partitions and observe behavior.

### Appendix: Practical code snippets (concept-level)
#### Example 1 — Simple idempotent HTTP write (pseudo-Python/Flask)
```python
# Client must provide an idempotency key in header
@app.route('/charge', methods=['POST'])
def charge():
    key = request.headers.get('Idempotency-Key')
    if storage.exists(key):
        return storage.get(key)
    result = process_charge(request.json)
    storage.put(key, result)
    return result
```

#### Example 2 — Produce to Kafka (conceptual)
```python
from confluent_kafka import Producer
p = Producer({'bootstrap.servers': 'broker1:9092'})

def send_event(topic, key, value):
    p.produce(topic, key=key, value=value)
    p.flush()
```

# Architecture Comparison: Monolithic vs Microservices vs Distributed Systems

---

## 📦 Monolithic Architecture

### ✅ Characteristics
- Entire application built as a single, unified unit
- All functionalities (UI, business logic, DB access) are tightly coupled
- Typically deployed as a single service

### 🔧 How it works
- One codebase
- One deployment package
- All components share memory and resources

### ⚙️ Example in Django
A traditional Django project with:
- One `settings.py`
- Apps: `users`, `products`, `orders` under one repo
- Shared database and server

```bash
# Single deployment
python manage.py runserver
```

### ✅ Pros
- Simple to develop & deploy
- Easier debugging
- Fewer DevOps complexities

### ❌ Cons
- Difficult to scale parts independently
- Tight coupling leads to harder maintenance
- Deployment risks: changes affect the whole system

---

## 🧩 Microservices Architecture

### ✅ Characteristics
- Application is split into multiple small services
- Each service is independently deployable
- Services communicate via APIs (REST, gRPC, etc.)

### ⚙️ Example
Separate services:
- `user-service` (Django REST)
- `product-service` (FastAPI)
- `order-service` (Node.js)

Each service:
- Has its own database
- Exposes its own API
- Is deployed individually (via Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)

```bash
# Docker example
docker-compose up user-service product-service order-service
```

### ✅ Pros
- Services can scale independently
- Easier to maintain and evolve features
- Technology agnostic: different stacks for different services

### ❌ Cons
- Complex communication (API/Queue)
- Requires strong DevOps skills
- Distributed transactions are difficult

---

## 🌐 Distributed Systems

### ✅ Characteristics
- System where components are located on different networked computers
- Communicate and coordinate via messages
- Can include microservices, databases, caches, and message brokers

### ⚙️ Real-world Example
E-commerce system with:
- Authentication service (JWT)
- Product microservice (FastAPI)
- Inventory microservice (Django)
- Payment gateway (3rd-party or internal)
- Redis (caching), RabbitMQ/Kafka (communication)

### ✅ Pros
- High availability
- Fault tolerance and scalability
- Services can evolve independently

### ❌ Cons
- Complex infrastructure and coordination
- Requires observability tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
- More failure points (network, serialization, timeouts)
