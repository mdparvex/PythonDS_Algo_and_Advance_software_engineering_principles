Multiple services are running same EC2 with docker-compose. Explained how they manage in EC2.

Perfect 👍 this is a very real-world situation, and I can see where the confusion is happening. Let me clear it step by step:

**🔹 1. One EC2, Many Services**

Yes — in your current setup, you’re running **many services inside a single EC2 instance** using Docker Compose.

- EC2 = one virtual server
- Inside EC2 → Docker Compose launches multiple **containers** (Postgres, Redis, Django APIs, Celery workers, etc.)
- All services share **the same EC2 public IP address**
- You expose different services by **binding different container ports → host ports** (like 8010, 8011, 8112 etc.)

👉 That’s why in your docker-compose.yaml, each service has a port mapping like "8010:80".  
So if your EC2 public IP = 3.93.12.100, then:

- <http://3.93.12.100:8010> → student service
- <http://3.93.12.100:8011> → API service
- <http://3.93.12.100:8012> → API cron
- etc.

⚠️ AWS does **not** give you a new IP per service/container. One EC2 → one public IP.  
If you want different IPs per service, you’d need **separate EC2 instances** (rarely efficient) or container orchestrators like **ECS/EKS/Kubernetes**.

**🔹 2. Mapping to DNS**

You typically don’t expose :8010, :8011, etc. directly in production. Instead, you use a **reverse proxy (Nginx or Traefik)** in front:

Example:

- api.example.com → forwards traffic to your **API container (8011)**
- student.example.com → forwards traffic to your **student container (8010)**
- teacher.example.com → forwards traffic to your **teacher container (8013)**

This way, users never see the raw port numbers. Everything goes through **port 80/443** at Nginx.

**🔹 3. Deployment Flow (from local → AWS)**

Here’s the **clean production flow** you should follow:

**🛠️ Step 1: Develop & Dockerize Locally**

- Each service has its own Dockerfile
- Test with docker-compose up locally

**🛠️ Step 2: Push to GitHub/GitLab**

- Keep all service code + docker-compose.yaml in repo

**🛠️ Step 3: Provision EC2**

- Create EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended)
- Install Docker + Docker Compose

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose
```

**🛠️ Step 4: Deploy**

- Clone repo into EC2
- Run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```
- All containers will run inside **one EC2**

**🛠️ Step 5: Add Nginx Reverse Proxy**

- Run **Nginx in front** of all services (like I showed earlier)
- Nginx listens on port 80/443 and routes based on **domain name**

Example Nginx config (nginx.conf):

```nginx
http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name api.example.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://api:8000;  # API container
        }
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name student.example.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://student:80; # student container
        }
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name teacher.example.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://teacher:80; # teacher container
        }
    }
}
```

**🛠️ Step 6: Point DNS to EC2**

- In your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Route53, etc.):
  - Add an **A record**:

    ```php-template
    api.example.com → <EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
    student.example.com → <EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
    teacher.example.com → <EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
    ```
- Now users can call APIs directly with subdomains.

**🔹 4. When You Outgrow One EC2**

Right now:

- One EC2 = all services
- Nginx = reverse proxy for routing

Later, when traffic grows:

- Use **AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer)** or **ECS/EKS** to spread containers across **multiple EC2s**
- Use **AWS Auto Scaling** to add/remove servers automatically
- At that stage, you stop thinking about “one EC2 running everything” and move to **orchestration**

✅ **Summary**

- One EC2 = one IP → all containers share it
- Services are separated by **ports internally**
- Expose them via **Nginx reverse proxy** and **domain names** (instead of :8010)
- For production:
  - **Single EC2 + Docker Compose + Nginx** is fine for MVP/small projects
  - **ECS/EKS + ALB + multiple EC2s** is the way for scale
