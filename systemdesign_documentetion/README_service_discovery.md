**📘 What is Service Discovery?**

**Service Discovery** is the process by which microservices (or distributed systems) automatically detect and communicate with each other without needing manual configuration of IP addresses or ports.

In microservice architecture, services are **dynamic** — they can scale up/down, restart, or move to different nodes. Manual IP/port management becomes impossible. **Service discovery solves this by providing an automatic way for services to find each other.**

**🔍 Types of Service Discovery**

| **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Client-Side** | The client queries a service registry and picks an instance. |
| **Server-Side** | The client sends a request to a load balancer, which routes to the service. |
| **DNS-Based** | Services are discoverable via DNS names. Kubernetes uses this. |

**🚀 How It Works in Kubernetes (your case)**

Kubernetes uses **built-in DNS-based service discovery**.

**🧱 Your Setup:**

You mentioned:

- live_reading running in Kubernetes
- student_api running in Kubernetes
- payment running on **EC2**

Let’s explore each case.

**✅ In-Kubernetes Services (DNS-Based)**

When you create a Kubernetes **Service** for your deployment, K8s automatically gives it a **DNS name** like:

```bash
http://&lt;service-name&gt;.&lt;namespace&gt;.svc.cluster.local
```
For example:

```bash
live-reading-service.default.svc.cluster.local
```
This means from **inside any other pod**, you can call:

```bash
<http://live-reading-service:8000>
```
So:

- student_api can call live_reading
- live_reading can call student_api

**without needing IPs**.

✅ This is **automatic service discovery via DNS** in Kubernetes.

**❌ External Services (EC2-Based)**

Your payment service runs on EC2, so it's **outside the cluster**. Kubernetes can’t auto-discover this.

**Solution**: You must do **manual service discovery** or use a tool like:

- Register it with **Consul**, **Eureka**, or **etcd**
- Use **environment variables** or **config maps** in Kubernetes to store the external payment service URL
- You may expose EC2 with a **Load Balancer**, then access via fixed domain/IP

**🔄 Example Flow**

Let's say:

- live_reading (on K8s) wants to call student_api (also K8s)
- student_api wants to call payment (on EC2)

**Code in live_reading:**

```python

import requests

# Service discovery in K8s

STUDENT_API_URL = "<http://student-api-service:8000/student/info>"

res = requests.get(STUDENT_API_URL)
```
**Code in student_api:**

```python

# Service discovery to EC2 via environment/config

PAYMENT_URL = os.environ.get("PAYMENT_URL", "<https://api.payment.com>")

res = requests.post(PAYMENT_URL, data=payment_data)
```

**🧠 Summary**

| **Concept** | **Kubernetes Services** | **External Services (e.g., EC2)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DNS Discovery | ✅ Built-in | ❌ Not available |
| Service Registry | 🔄 Internal Kube DNS | ❌ Manual or use Consul |
| Needs IP config? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (via config/env) |

**🛠 Tools for Service Discovery (if scaling)**

| **Tool** | **Used For** |
| --- | --- |
| **Kube-DNS / CoreDNS** | Kubernetes internal services |
| **Consul** | Microservices across clusters |
| **Eureka** | Java/Spring Boot-based systems |
| **etcd** | Core to Kubernetes’ own internal discovery |
