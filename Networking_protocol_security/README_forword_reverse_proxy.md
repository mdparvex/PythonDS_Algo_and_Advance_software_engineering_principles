## 1. Executive Summary
A **proxy server** acts as an intermediary between clients and servers. There are two major types: **forward proxy** (client-facing) and **reverse proxy** (server-facing). This documentation explains their concepts, workflows, differences, and practical use cases.

---

## 2. What is a Proxy Server?
A proxy server is a system that sits between a client and a destination server. It intercepts requests and forwards them on behalf of the client or server.

**Benefits:**
- Security (masking IPs, controlling access)
- Performance (caching, load balancing)
- Monitoring and logging
- Access control and filtering

---

## 3. Forward Proxy
### 3.1 Definition
A forward proxy (commonly just called a "proxy") is placed between a **client** and the **internet**. The client’s requests go to the proxy, which forwards them to the destination server.

### 3.2 How it works
```
Client -> Forward Proxy -> Internet (Server)
```
- Client configures proxy in its settings.
- Proxy makes requests on behalf of the client.
- Destination server only sees the proxy’s IP address.

### 3.3 Examples
- **Squid Proxy**
- **Apache HTTP Forward Proxy**
- **CCProxy**

### 3.4 Use Cases
- **Access control:** Restrict employee access to certain websites.
- **Privacy/Anonymity:** Hide client IPs when browsing.
- **Content filtering:** Block social media or malicious websites.
- **Bypassing restrictions:** Access geo-restricted or censored content.

---

## 4. Reverse Proxy
### 4.1 Definition
A reverse proxy sits in front of **servers** and handles requests from clients on behalf of the servers.

### 4.2 How it works
```
Client -> Reverse Proxy -> Backend Servers
```
- Client requests go to the proxy first.
- Proxy forwards them to the correct backend server.
- Proxy may cache, load balance, or apply security rules.

### 4.3 Examples
- **Nginx**
- **HAProxy**
- **Apache HTTP Server (mod_proxy)**
- **Traefik**

### 4.4 Use Cases
- **Load balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
- **SSL termination:** Offload encryption/decryption.
- **Caching:** Reduce load by serving cached responses.
- **Security:** Hide backend server IPs, prevent DDoS attacks.
- **Application firewall:** Filter malicious requests.

| Hides identity of    | Client                                 | Server                                   |

---

## 6. Common Implementations
- **Forward proxy:** Squid, CCProxy, Apache HTTPD (forward mode).
- **Reverse proxy:** Nginx, HAProxy, Traefik, AWS ALB/ELB.

**Example: Nginx reverse proxy config**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_server:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

**Example: Squid forward proxy config**
```
http_port 3128
acl allowed_sites dstdomain .example.com
http_access allow allowed_sites
http_access deny all
```

---

## 7. Security Considerations
- Forward proxy:
  - Ensure authentication to prevent abuse (open proxies).
  - Log requests responsibly.
- Reverse proxy:
  - Protect against DDoS by rate-limiting.
  - Use WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules.
  - Terminate SSL at proxy and secure backend traffic.

---

## 8. Performance and Scaling
- **Forward Proxy:** Can cache frequently accessed web resources to reduce bandwidth usage.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Can cache static content, compress responses, and distribute traffic among multiple servers.

---

## 9. Design Checklist and Best Practices
- Choose the correct proxy type for your use case.
- Avoid single points of failure (use multiple proxies with failover).
- Enable logging and monitoring.
- Secure proxies with firewalls, ACLs, and authentication.
- Regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities.

---

## 10. Glossary
- **Proxy:** Intermediary between client and server.
- **Forward Proxy:** Client-side proxy that controls outbound requests.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Server-side proxy that manages inbound requests.
- **Caching:** Storing responses for faster retrieval.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributing requests across multiple servers.

## 1\. 🛰️ Introduction to Proxies

A **proxy** is an intermediary server between a client and another server. It’s commonly used for routing, filtering, monitoring, load balancing, and caching.

Two common types:

- **Forward Proxy**: Represents the client.
- **Reverse Proxy**: Represents the server.

## 2\. 🔄 Forward Proxy

### 🔹 What It Is

A **forward proxy** sits **in front of the client** and acts on behalf of the client when making requests to external servers.

### 🔹 Common Use Cases

- Browsing anonymously
- Enforcing organizational security/firewall rules
- Accessing geolocation-restricted content

### 🔹 Diagram

```arduino
Client → Forward Proxy → Internet → Web Server
```
### 🔹 Example

Configuring Squid as a forward proxy or setting up a VPN to bypass local restrictions.

## 3\. 🔁 Reverse Proxy

### 🔹 What It Is

A **reverse proxy** sits **in front of backend servers** and routes client requests to appropriate backend services.

### 🔹 Features

- Load balancing
- SSL termination
- Caching static assets
- Security via IP whitelisting or rate limiting

### 🔹 Diagram

```arduino
Client → Reverse Proxy → App Server
                      → Static Server
                      → Auth Server

```
### 🔹 Example

Nginx or HAProxy handling requests to multiple microservices behind a single public IP.

## 4\. 🌐 CDN as a Reverse Proxy

### 🔹 What is a CDN?

A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** caches static content like images, CSS, JS, or even entire HTML pages closer to the user.

### 🔹 CDN as a Reverse Proxy

A CDN acts as a **reverse proxy** by caching responses and serving them on behalf of the origin server.

### 🔹 Benefits

- Faster content delivery
- Load reduction on origin server
- Automatic DDoS protection
- Built-in TLS (HTTPS)

### 🔹 Example Providers

- Cloudflare
- Akamai
- AWS CloudFront
- Fastly

### 🔹 Diagram

```arduino
Client → CDN (Reverse Proxy) → Origin Server

```

## 5\. 🚪 Nginx as an API Gateway

An **API Gateway** routes API requests to appropriate backend services. Nginx can be configured to act as one.

### 🔹 Responsibilities

- Routing (e.g., /api/v1/users → User service)
- Rate limiting
- Authentication
- Response transformation
- Load balancing

### 🔹 Suitable For

- Microservices architecture
- Frontend/backend separation
- Mobile + Web API integration

## 6\. ⚙️ Sample Nginx Configurations

### 📍 Basic Reverse Proxy Setup

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # Forward to backend app
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}

```

### 📍 API Gateway with Multiple Services

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api.example.com;

    location /users/ {
        proxy_pass http://user_service:8000/;
    }

    location /orders/ {
        proxy_pass http://order_service:8001/;
    }

    location /auth/ {
        proxy_pass http://auth_service:8002/;
    }
}

```

### 📍 Add Rate Limiting

```nginx
http {
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=1r/s;

    server {
        listen 80;

        location /api/ {
            limit_req zone=mylimit burst=5;
            proxy_pass http://api_backend;
        }
    }
}

```

### 📍 Load Balancing Multiple Backends

```nginx
upstream backend {
    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
}

server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
    }
}

```

### 📍 SSL Termination Example

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name api.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    }
}

```

## 7\. ✅ Best Practices

- Always validate headers (X-Forwarded-For, Host) to avoid spoofing.
- Use HTTPS (TLS termination at proxy).
- Use health checks with load balancers.
- Enable caching for static assets.
- Apply rate limiting and IP blacklisting.

## 8\. 🧭 When to Use What

| **Use Case** | **Use** | **Tool/Tech** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Control client browsing | Forward proxy | Squid, Privoxy |
| Distribute client requests to backend | Reverse proxy | Nginx, HAProxy |
| Serve global static assets | CDN | Cloudflare, Fastly |
| Aggregate microservice APIs | API Gateway | Nginx, Kong, Ambassador |
| Secure and throttle API usage | API Gateway | Nginx with Lua module or plugins |

## ✅ Summary
