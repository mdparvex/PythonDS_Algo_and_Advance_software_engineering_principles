Let's dive into a **deep, technical, and practical comparison** of **DynamoDB vs MongoDB vs Cassandra**, and analyze **when and why** you'd choose each one.

# ⚔️ **DynamoDB vs MongoDB vs Cassandra - Deep Technical Comparison**

## 🧠 1. Overview

| **Database** | **Type** | **Ownership** | **Nature** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Amazon DynamoDB** | Key-Value & Document Store | Managed by AWS | Fully Managed Cloud Service |
| **MongoDB** | Document Store | Open Source (MongoDB Inc.) | Self-Managed or Cloud (Atlas) |
| **Apache Cassandra** | Wide Column Store | Open Source (Apache Foundation) | Self-Managed or Cloud (Keyspaces) |

## 🧩 2. Data Model

| **Feature** | **DynamoDB** | **MongoDB** | **Cassandra** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Model Type** | Key-Value / Document | Document (JSON-like BSON) | Wide Column (Table-like) |
| **Schema** | Schema-less | Schema-less | Schema-lite (needs table definition) |
| **Structure** | Tables → Items → Attributes | Collections → Documents → Fields | Keyspace → Tables → Rows → Columns |
| **Primary Key** | Partition Key (and optional Sort Key) | \_id (auto or custom) | Partition Key (and optional Clustering Key) |
| **Query Flexibility** | Query only via keys and indexes | Flexible (ad-hoc queries, nested fields) | Requires known partition key |
| **Relationships** | Limited (no joins) | Supports embedded docs and references | None (denormalized) |

📘 **Example**

- **DynamoDB:** { "user_id": "U123", "name": "Alice", "age": 25 }
- **MongoDB:** { "\_id": ObjectId("..."), "name": "Alice", "age": 25 }
- **Cassandra:** user_id and age as columns in a row under a table.

## ⚙️ 3. Scalability Model

| **Feature** | **DynamoDB** | **MongoDB** | **Cassandra** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Scalability Type** | Horizontal (auto) | Manual sharding or Atlas autoscaling | Horizontal (peer-to-peer) |
