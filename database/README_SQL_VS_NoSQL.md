# NoSQL Comparison: Cassandra · MongoDB · DynamoDB

**Purpose:** a technical, decision-focused document to help you pick the best NoSQL engine for your project. It covers architecture, data model, consistency, scaling, querying, ops, cost, real-world trade-offs, and concrete decision checkpoints - plus short example schemas so you can compare how the same problem looks in each system.

# Executive summary (TL;DR)

- **Cassandra** - best for **massive write throughput**, geo-distributed deployments, and predictable low-latency at scale when you can design query-driven partitions. High ops burden if self-hosted. [Apache Cassandra+1](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/overview.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **MongoDB** - best for **flexible JSON document modeling**, rich ad-hoc queries & aggregations, and developer productivity. Good if you need multi-document transactions and complex query/analytics. Managed Atlas reduces ops. [MongoDB+1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **DynamoDB** - best if you want **serverless, fully managed** NoSQL on AWS with automatic scaling, predictable latencies and tight AWS integration; you must design around access patterns and partition keys. Global Tables enable multi-region active-active replication. [AWS Documentation+1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/capacity-mode.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 1\. Core architecture & data model

### Apache Cassandra

- **Model:** wide-column (tables → rows → partition key + clustering columns). Data modeling is query-driven: you design partitions and clustering to satisfy queries (denormalized schemas are normal). [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/overview.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Architecture:** peer-to-peer ring, gossip protocol for node discovery, tunable replication strategy per keyspace. Every node can accept reads/writes; no single primary. Write-path: client → commit log → memtable → SSTables (append/merge compaction). Works well for linear scale-out. [DataStax Documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/architecture/archTOC.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### MongoDB

- **Model:** document (BSON). Flexible schema; nested documents and arrays. Good for natural JSON mapping, variable fields, and evolving schemas. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Architecture:** replica sets (primary + secondaries) provide HA; sharding spreads data across shards using a shard key for horizontal scale. The primary handles writes (unless you use multi-primary managed solutions). [MongoDB+1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/replication/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Amazon DynamoDB

- **Model:** key-value / document. Items with attributes, primary key is partition key or (partition, sort) key. Secondary indexes (GSI/LSI) enable alternate access patterns but have limits & costs. Design is access-pattern centric. [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Architecture:** fully managed, partitioned, serverless. AWS handles partitioning, replication, failover, storage. Global Tables support multi-region multi-master replication. [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 2\. Consistency, durability & transactions

- **Cassandra:** tunable consistency at operation level (ONE, QUORUM, ALL). Default is eventual; you can choose stronger guarantees per-read/write but at latency cost. Lightweight transactions (compare-and-set / Paxos) exist but are not same as general multi-row ACID transactions. [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/overview.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **MongoDB:** single-document operations are strongly consistent on primary by default; **supports multi-document ACID transactions** across replica sets and sharded clusters (since MongoDB 4.0/4.2), enabling relational-style transactional flows when needed. Durability depends on write concern (e.g., w: "majority"). [MongoDB+1](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **DynamoDB:** per-item atomic operations plus **ACID transactions** APIs (TransactWriteItems, TransactGetItems) for multi-item atomicity. Read options: eventually consistent (default) or strongly consistent (within a region). Global Tables are eventually consistent across regions. [AWS Documentation+1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/transaction-apis.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 3\. Scaling & performance characteristics

- **Cassandra**
  - **Strengths:** linear horizontal scaling for both reads and especially writes; great for write-heavy, high-throughput workloads. Designed for multi-DC deployments with no single point of failure. [Apache Cassandra+1](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/overview.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  - **Caveats:** requires careful partitioning design to avoid hotspots; reads are heavier than writes due to SSTable merges and possible coordinator reads across replicas.
- **MongoDB**
  - **Strengths:** shardable for horizontal scaling; flexible queries and secondary indexes make many read patterns easy. Managed Atlas handles many scaling concerns. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/sharding/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  - **Caveats:** pick the shard key carefully; cross-shard queries and heavy aggregations can be expensive at scale.
- **DynamoDB**
  - **Strengths:** automatic, near-infinite scale (On-Demand or Provisioned with autoscaling). AWS advertises single-digit millisecond latencies for well-designed workloads. On-Demand tables can absorb sudden spikes (with documented limits). [AWS Documentation+1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/on-demand-capacity-mode.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  - **Caveats:** design must avoid hot partition keys; scans or unbounded queries are expensive; GSIs add cost & capacity considerations.

# 4\. Querying, indexing, and analytics

- **Cassandra:** CQL (SQL-like) but **query-first**: you model tables for the queries you need. Secondary indexes exist but are limited for scale; full ad-hoc aggregations are not native - use Spark/Presto/Flink for analytics. [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/overview.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **MongoDB:** rich query language, powerful **Aggregation Framework**, text & geospatial search, and change streams for event-driven apps. Well-suited to ad-hoc queries and operational analytics. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **DynamoDB:** Query/Scan by keys and indexes. Supports PartiQL (SQL-like syntax) for convenience, but true ad-hoc analytics require offloading (DynamoDB Streams → S3/Athena, or export). Avoid heavy scans. [AWS Documentation+1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 5\. Operational complexity & ecosystem

- **Cassandra:** higher ops burden when self-hosting - node repair, compaction, JVM tuning, repairs, topology changes, and careful monitoring required. Managed vendors (DataStax, Instaclustr) and cloud offerings (Amazon Keyspaces for Cassandra-compatible API) reduce this. [instaclustr.com+1](https://www.instaclustr.com/blog/cassandra-architecture/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **MongoDB:** moderate ops; running replica sets & sharded clusters requires operational knowledge but tooling and managed MongoDB Atlas simplify most tasks (backups, monitoring, scaling). Strong driver ecosystem. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **DynamoDB:** minimal ops - AWS manages everything. Tradeoffs: less visibility/control of underlying infra and vendor lock-in to AWS. Excellent integration with AWS services (Lambda, IAM, API Gateway, CloudWatch). [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 6\. Cost model (practical notes)

- **Cassandra (self-hosted):** cost = compute + storage + network + ops personnel. At very large scale self-hosting may reduce raw \$/GB costs but increases ops staffing. Managed Cassandra/DBaaS adds subscription fees. [DataStax Documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/cassandraAbout.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **MongoDB:** self-hosted vs Atlas - Atlas pricing depends on instance size, I/O, backups, region. Atlas reduces ops overhead at added cost. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **DynamoDB:** pay for reads/writes/storage; Provisioned vs On-Demand pricing models; additional charge for DAX, Streams, backups, Global Tables. On-Demand is convenient for unpredictable workloads; sustained heavy throughput can become expensive - model with expected R/W patterns. [AWS Documentation+1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/capacity-mode.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 7\. Ecosystem & integrations

- **Cassandra:** integrates well with Kafka, Spark, Flink, Presto; commonly used in big-data pipelines and time-series stacks. Managed providers offer enterprise features. [instaclustr.com](https://www.instaclustr.com/blog/cassandra-architecture/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **MongoDB:** broad language drivers, BI Connector, change streams, Atlas Charts, full ecosystem for application development and analytics. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **DynamoDB:** native AWS integration (Lambda, Kinesis, API Gateway, IAM), Streams for eventing, PartiQL for SQL-like access; strong for serverless architectures. [AWS Documentation+1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 8\. Typical use-cases (short)

- **Cassandra:** IoT telemetry, time-series, write-heavy event stores, global event logging, user activity feeds at massive scale. [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/overview.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **MongoDB:** content management, product catalogs, user profiles, operational analytics, apps needing flexible JSON and complex queries. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **DynamoDB:** serverless APIs, gaming leaderboards, session stores, high-scale web backends, globally distributed workloads with Global Tables. [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 9\. Concrete trade-offs (short table)

| **Concern** | **Cassandra** | **MongoDB** | **DynamoDB** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data model | Wide column, query-first | Document, schema-flexible | Key-value/document, access-pattern first |
| Ops | High (self-manage) | Medium (Atlas helps) | Low (fully managed) |
| Transactions | Lightweight CAS; no general multi-row ACID | Multi-document ACID transactions | ACID transactions API available |
| Scaling | Linear, multi-DC | Sharding; good but needs careful shard keys | Automatic, managed, global |
| Query power | Limited (CQL) | Rich (aggregation, indexes) | Key/index driven; PartiQL for convenience |
| Best if | Massive writes, multi-DC | Rich queries, evolving schemas | Serverless, AWS-first, predictable access patterns |

# 10\. Decision checklist (answer yes/no to guide choice)

- Is **write throughput & multi-DC availability** a top priority? → Lean **Cassandra**.
- Do you need **rich ad-hoc queries, aggregations, and flexible JSON**? → Lean **MongoDB**.
- Do you want **minimal ops + serverless / AWS integration**? → Lean **DynamoDB**.
- Do you need **multi-document ACID transactions** often? → **MongoDB** (or **DynamoDB** if your access patterns permit transactional grouping across keys).
- Are you willing to **design data model specifically around queries & keys**? → **Cassandra / DynamoDB**.  
    (If answers are mixed, prefer prototyping - see section 12.)

# 11\. Example: same dataset mapped three ways

**Use-case:** user activity feed (append-only): events {user_id, event_time, event_type, payload}; queries: (A) append events, (B) get latest N events per user, (C) range by time per user.

### Cassandra (wide-column)

Table: user_events (user_id, event_time, event_id, event_type, payload)  
Primary key: (user_id, event_time) with event_time as clustering DESC.

- Appends are fast; reads for user's latest N are efficient (single partition). Must ensure partition cardinality (not too large) or use bucketing (e.g., user_id + year_month) to limit partition growth. [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/overview.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### MongoDB (document per event, collection user_events)

Document: { user_id, event_time, event_type, payload }  
Indexes: compound index { user_id:1, event_time:-1 }

- Appends are simple inserts. Query latest N via index. Good ad-hoc querying of payload fields. Transactions not required for append-only. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### DynamoDB (items)

Table PK: user_id (partition key), SK: event_time (sort key)

- Query latest N via Query API with Limit and ScanIndexForward=false. Use On-Demand or provision capacity for expected writes. Be mindful of heavy single-user hotspots; consider sharding user_id (user_id#bucket) for very active users. [AWS Documentation+1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ql-reference.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 12\. Migration & prototyping recommendations

- **Prototype with real workloads.** Generate realistic traffic (RPS, read/write ratio, object sizes, query shapes) and run load tests; NoSQL behavior is access-pattern dependent.
- **Model queries first.** For Cassandra/DynamoDB, list every access pattern and map keys/indexes before schema design. For MongoDB, think in documents / embedding vs referencing. [Apache Cassandra+1](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/overview.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Start managed.** If ops is not the core competency, prefer managed services (MongoDB Atlas, DataStax Astra, Amazon DynamoDB / Amazon Keyspaces) to reduce time-to-production. [DataStax Documentation+1](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/cassandraAbout.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Monitor & observe.** Track latency, partition hotness, compaction/GC (Cassandra), IOPS and throttling (DynamoDB), and sharding balance (MongoDB).
- **Cost modeling.** For DynamoDB, model R/W units or On-Demand costs; for Cassandra/MongoDB, model instance sizes, storage, network and human ops costs.

# 13\. Final recommendations (practical scenarios)

- **If you run a global, write-heavy telemetry pipeline** (millions writes/sec, multi-region): **Cassandra** (or managed Cassandra) is the likely fit. [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/architecture/overview.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **If you need rapid product development, complex queries, and JSON documents** (CMS, catalogs, dashboards): **MongoDB** (Atlas for managed). [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **If your infra is on AWS and you want serverless with automatic scale & global replication**: **DynamoDB** (design for access patterns). [AWS Documentation+1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 14\. Next actionable steps I can do for you

Choose one and I'll produce a concrete deliverable (I'll implement it now in this message - no delays):

- A compact **decision matrix** where you tell me: expected RPS, read/write ratio, number of regions, budget constraints, and query complexity → I'll recommend one DB and justify with a short bill-of-materials and capacity estimates.
- **Example schemas + CQL / MongoDB JSON / DynamoDB PartiQL** for a specific domain (e.g., product catalog, activity feed, sessions).
- A **migration checklist** (dumps, ETL, downtime strategy, data validation) from relational DB → chosen NoSQL.
