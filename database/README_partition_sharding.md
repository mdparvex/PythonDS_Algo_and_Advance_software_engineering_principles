# ðŸ“š Database Partitioning and Sharding in Django

Database partitioning and sharding are techniques used to **manage large datasets** efficiently, **improve query performance**, and **scale applications**. Letâ€™s break them down with clear definitions, comparisons, and Django-focused examples.

## ðŸ”¹ What is Database Partitioning?

### âœ… Definition:
Partitioning is the process of **dividing a large database table into smaller, more manageable pieces (partitions)**. All the partitions remain in the same database system.

### âœ… Why It's Used:
- Improves performance (queries can scan only relevant partitions)
- Easier maintenance (e.g., archiving old data)
- Helps avoid table size limits or performance bottlenecks

### âœ… Types of Partitioning:
1. **Range Partitioning**: Rows are partitioned based on a range of column values.
2. **List Partitioning**: Partitioned by predefined lists of values.
3. **Hash Partitioning**: Rows are distributed across partitions using a hash function.

### âœ… PostgreSQL Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE student_results (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    exam_date DATE,
    score INT
) PARTITION BY RANGE (exam_date);

CREATE TABLE student_results_2023 PARTITION OF student_results
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2024-01-01');

CREATE TABLE student_results_2024 PARTITION OF student_results
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
```

### âœ… In Django (with PostgreSQL):
You can use the `django-postgres-extra` or `django-partial-index` packages, or handle it via raw SQL migrations.

Example (Raw migration):
```python
# migrations/0002_partition.py
from django.db import migrations

class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    dependencies = [('yourapp', '0001_initial')]

    operations = [
        migrations.RunSQL("""
            CREATE TABLE yourapp_logs (
                id serial PRIMARY KEY,
                created_at timestamp NOT NULL,
                message text NOT NULL
            ) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);
        """)
    ]
```

## ðŸ”¹ What is Database Sharding?

### âœ… Definition:
Sharding is the practice of **splitting a database into multiple independent databases (shards)**. Each shard holds a portion of the data, and they may even live on separate servers or geographic regions.

### âœ… Why It's Used:
- Horizontally scales databases for very large applications
- Distributes load across multiple servers
- Reduces contention and lock conflicts

### âœ… When to Use:
- Millions of users or records
- Performance bottlenecks in single-node DB
- High availability or geo-distribution needed

### âœ… Django Sharding Example (using `django-sharding` or manual routing):
You define multiple databases in `settings.py`:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {},
    'shard_1': {...},
    'shard_2': {...},
}
```

Then, route models manually:
```python
class ShardedRouter:
    def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
        user_id = hints.get('user_id')
        if user_id % 2 == 0:
            return 'shard_1'
        return 'shard_2'

    def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
        return self.db_for_read(model, **hints)
```

And in your views:
```python
User.objects.using('shard_1').filter(name='Mamun')
```

## ðŸ§  Partitioning vs Sharding

| Feature           | Partitioning                       | Sharding                                |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Scope             | Inside a single database           | Across multiple databases/servers        |
| Managed by        | Database engine                    | Application or DB proxy layer            |
| Use Case          | Table-level performance boost      | Application-scale horizontal scaling     |
| Query Simplicity  | Transparent to query engine        | Requires routing logic                   |

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary in Django Context:

| Scenario                          | Recommended Approach |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| You have 100 million logs/year   | Use PostgreSQL range partitioning |
| Your app has 5M+ users worldwide | Shard users by region (e.g., EU, US) |
| Your tables grow vertically fast | Partition by date or ID |
| You want fault isolation         | Shard across independent databases |

### âœ… Partitioning vs Sharding â€” Clarification

You're almost correct, and here's a clearer distinction:

#### âœ… Database Partitioning
- **What:** Divides one large table into smaller partitions (chunks).
- **Where Stored:** Same database instance.
- **Why:** For performance and maintenance efficiency.
- **How:** Commonly partitioned by ranges (e.g., date, region).
- **Example:** 
    - `users_asia`, `users_europe` under the same PostgreSQL DB.
- **Django:** PostgreSQL handles partitioning; ORM is unaware.

#### âœ… Database Sharding
- **What:** Splits data across completely separate databases.
- **Where Stored:** Different database instances (e.g., multiple AWS RDS).
- **Why:** For large-scale horizontal scaling and isolation.
- **How:** Routing logic based on shard key (e.g., user_id).
- **Example:**
    - Users with ID < 50000 â†’ DB1; ID â‰¥ 50000 â†’ DB2
- **Django:** Use [database routers](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/multi-db/) for routing.

#### âœ… Key Differences

| Feature               | Partitioning                           | Sharding                              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Storage location      | Same database                          | Different databases                    |
| Purpose               | Query speed, performance tuning        | Scalability, high availability         |
| Setup complexity      | Lower                                  | Higher (needs routing logic)           |
| Django support        | Indirect (via raw SQL or 3rd party)    | Supported via database routers         |
