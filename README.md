# PythonDS_Algo

A personal repository of data structures & algorithms (DSA) practice solutions, algorithm implementations, and software engineering notes (system design, CI/CD, databases, Kubernetes, and more).

This README gives a concise map of the project, links into main topic folders, usage tips, contribution notes, and suggested next steps.

## Overview

This workspace is organized as a study and reference collection for common algorithm problems (searching, sorting, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, data structures like heaps/tries/linked-lists) and supplementary notes about engineering topics such as databases, messaging, CI/CD, Kubernetes, and system design.

Files are small, focused Python scripts or markdown notes intended for learning, interview prep, and quick reference.

## Repository Structure

Below are the top-level folders and a short description for each. Click a folder name to jump to it in supported viewers (or open the folder in your editor):

- `API/` — README notes covering REST, GraphQL, gRPC, SOAP and API negotiation patterns.
- `binary_search/` — Implementations and practice problems focused on binary search and rotated-array variants.
- `ci_cd/` — Notes and guides for CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes end-to-end considerations.
- `CSE373prac/` — Course practice (AVL trees, mergesort, fibonacci, binary search, etc.).
- `database/` — Extensive documentation on databases, indexing, replication, ORMs, and performance tuning.
- `graph/` — Graph algorithms and related utilities.
- `greedyAlgo/` — Greedy algorithm examples (activity selection).
- `hackerrank/` — Solutions to selected HackerRank problems.
- `hash/` — Hashing examples and notes.
- `heap/` — Heap implementations and operations.
- `kubernetes/` — Kubernetes-related notes and troubleshooting tips.
- `linklist/` — Linked list problems and utilities (merge, reorder, LRU cache, random pointer copy, etc.).
- `list_two_pointer/` — Two-pointer technique problems (container with most water, rotate, longest-substring variants).
- `massage_broker/` — Messaging broker examples and notes (folder placeholder).
- `Networking_protocol_security/` — Notes on networking protocols and security practices.
- `practice/` — Miscellaneous practice problems.
- `python/` — Miscellaneous Python utilities and scripts.
- `Python_design_patterns_oop/` — Design pattern examples in Python.
- `queue/`, `recursion/`, `stack/`, `tree/`, `trie_prefix_tree/` — Collections of problems for each data structure.
- `Resources/` — Helpful references and external resources (links, cheat-sheets).
- `README.md` — (this file) repository overview.

Note: Some folders may contain additional README files that dive deeper into a topic. Open them to read topic-specific guidance.

## How to use this repo

1. Open the project in your editor (VS Code recommended).
2. Browse the folders above and open a Python file to read or run.
3. Each algorithm file typically contains a function or class and may include a small example or edge-case handling. You can run individual scripts with your Python interpreter.

Example (PowerShell):

```powershell
python .\binary_search\binary_search.py
```

Or run a specific script directly from VS Code by opening it and using the Run action.

## Key Topics (quick links)

- Binary search & rotated arrays: `binary_search/`
- Trees & BSTs: `CSE373prac/`, `tree/`
- Linked lists: `linklist/`
- Greedy & two-pointer patterns: `greedyAlgo/`, `list_two_pointer/`
- Heaps & priority queues: `heap/`
- Graph algorithms: `graph/`
- Databases & system design notes: `database/`
- Kubernetes & CI/CD: `kubernetes/`, `ci_cd/`

If you want a recommendation for what to read first, start with `binary_search/` for algorithm practice and `database/` or `ci_cd/` for engineering notes.

## Running / Testing Python snippets

- This repo assumes you have Python 3.8+ installed. Use a virtual environment for experiments.
- To run a single file from PowerShell:

```powershell
python path\to\file.py
```

- To run multiple examples or to add tests, consider adding pytest test files and running `pytest` from the repo root.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:

1. Fork or create a branch for your change.
2. Add or update a Python file or documentation.
3. If adding code, include a short docstring and a small example or unit test.
4. Submit a pull request describing the change and why it helps.

Coding guidelines:

- Keep functions small and focused.
- Prefer descriptive names and add short docstrings.
- When adding new problem solutions, include problem name and source (e.g., LeetCode/HackerRank) in the file header.

## Style & Conventions

- Files use plain Python. There is no enforced formatter in this repo, but consistent formatting (PEP8) is recommended.
- Use type hints when helpful but keep examples simple and easy to run.

## License & Attribution

This repository is a personal collection of learning materials. If you include or adapt solutions from online judges (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.), please keep attribution comments in the file header.
