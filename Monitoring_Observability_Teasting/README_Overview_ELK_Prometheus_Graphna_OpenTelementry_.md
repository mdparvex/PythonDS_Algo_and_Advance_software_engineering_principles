**🧩 Overview: ELK, Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry**

| **Tool** | **Category** | **Main Purpose** | **Common Use** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) | Logging & Search | Collect, process, store, and visualize **logs** | Application log management & search |
| **Prometheus** | Metrics Monitoring | Collect and store **time-series metrics** (CPU, memory, latency, etc.) | Infrastructure & application performance monitoring |
| **Grafana** | Visualization & Alerting | Create **dashboards** for metrics/logs tracing from multiple sources | Visualization and alerting on data from Prometheus, ELK, etc. |
| **OpenTelemetry (OTel)** | Observability Framework | **Collect traces, metrics, and logs** in a vendor-neutral way | Unified instrumentation for distributed systems |

**🔍 1. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**

**🔧 Components:**

- **Elasticsearch:** Full-text search and analytics engine for storing logs.
- **Logstash:** Data processing pipeline - collects and transforms logs from multiple sources before sending to Elasticsearch.
- **Kibana:** Visualization dashboard for logs and metrics stored in Elasticsearch.

**🧠 Purpose:**

To **centralize and analyze application logs** across multiple services and servers.

**💡 Use Case / Problem Solved:**

"My microservices produce tons of logs on different servers - I need a way to collect, search, and visualize them."

✅ **Solution with ELK:**

- Use **Logstash/Filebeat** to collect logs.
- Store them in **Elasticsearch** (searchable, index-based).
- Visualize errors, request logs, or trends in **Kibana** dashboards.

**📈 Example:**

If your Django app crashes occasionally, you can:

- Send logs to ELK.
- Search logs by request ID or error keyword in Kibana.
- Detect what endpoint caused it.

**📊 2. Prometheus**

**🔧 What It Does:**

Prometheus **collects and stores metrics** (numerical time-series data) - like CPU usage, memory, request latency, or API throughput.

**🧠 Purpose:**

To **monitor system health and performance** over time.

**💡 Use Case / Problem Solved:**

"I want to know if my servers are under heavy load, or if API latency spikes."

✅ **Solution with Prometheus:**

- Applications expose metrics at /metrics endpoint.
- Prometheus scrapes them periodically.
- You can query metrics using **PromQL** (Prometheus Query Language).
- Integrates with **Grafana** for visualization.

**📈 Example:**

- Track CPU usage over time.
- Set alert: "Alert if response time > 2s for more than 5 minutes."

**📉 3. Grafana**

**🔧 What It Does:**

Grafana is a **visualization and analytics tool** for all your observability data - metrics, logs, traces.

**🧠 Purpose:**

To **build real-time dashboards and alerts** from various data sources like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, or OpenTelemetry.

**💡 Use Case / Problem Solved:**

"I want a single dashboard that shows app latency, error rates, and resource usage."

✅ **Solution with Grafana:**

- Connect Prometheus → show CPU, memory, response time.
- Connect Elasticsearch → show error logs.
- Add alert rules (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty).

**📈 Example Dashboard:**

- Panel 1: CPU usage over time.
- Panel 2: Error count by endpoint (from ELK).
- Panel 3: Latency distribution.
- Panel 4: User activity rate.

**🌐 4. OpenTelemetry (OTel)**

**🔧 What It Does:**

OpenTelemetry is a **standardized observability framework** that collects **traces, metrics, and logs** from your application - regardless of backend.

**🧠 Purpose:**

To **instrument your code once** and send telemetry data to any backend (Prometheus, ELK, Grafana, Jaeger, etc.).

**💡 Use Case / Problem Solved:**

"I have microservices in Python, Node, and Go. I want to trace a single request across all services."

✅ **Solution with OpenTelemetry:**

- Add OTel SDK in each service.
- Automatically capture traces, metrics, logs.
- Export to Prometheus, Grafana Tempo, or Jaeger.

**📈 Example:**

If a request goes:
```nginx
Frontend → API Gateway → Auth Service → DB Service
```
OpenTelemetry can:

- Trace the request across all components.
- Measure latency at each stage.
- Send data to Grafana for visualization.

**🧠 Putting It All Together: Complete Observability Stack**

| **Layer** | **Tool** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Logs** | ELK (Logstash + Elasticsearch + Kibana) | Collect, store, and visualize application logs |
| **Metrics** | Prometheus | Collect system and application performance metrics |
| **Visualization** | Grafana | Unified dashboard and alerts |
| **Tracing** | OpenTelemetry | Distributed tracing and correlation between metrics/logs |

**Example Real-World Setup:**

- Django app logs → ELK
- API performance metrics → Prometheus
- Unified dashboard → Grafana
- Request traces → OpenTelemetry

**🧩 When to Use Which**

| **Scenario** | **Recommended Tool** |
| --- | --- |
| Searching through logs or debugging errors | **ELK Stack** |
| Monitoring CPU, memory, or response times | **Prometheus + Grafana** |
| Creating dashboards & alerts | **Grafana** |
| Tracing user requests across services | **OpenTelemetry** |
| Full observability (logs + metrics + traces) | **OpenTelemetry + Prometheus + Grafana (and possibly ELK)** |

**🚀 Example Problem & Solution**

**Problem:**  
Your distributed system (10 microservices) is slow; you don't know why.

**Solution Workflow:**

- **OpenTelemetry** traces the request path → finds that the "Payment Service" is slow.
- **Prometheus** shows high CPU usage on that container.
- **ELK** shows repeated DB connection timeout errors.
- **Grafana** displays all of the above visually with alerts.

Now you know:

- **Root cause:** Payment Service DB timeout.
- **Impact:** 20% latency increase.
- **Resolution:** Optimize DB pool or query.
